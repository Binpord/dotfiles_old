# configs
Repository for my config files (bashrc, vimrc, tmux.conf, etc).

Mind that this files should be stored at ~/ (your home directory) and be hiden. That is why for most of them (all for now) I expect to copy them by running commands <git clone ... + cd dir + ln filename ~/.filename>.  
All files that supposed to be stored somwhere except of the ~ directory are listed here:  
1) ycm_extra_conf.py should be located in ~/.vim/ . Special thanks for the conf to https://github.com/JDevlieghere/dotfiles/ .
